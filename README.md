DESCRIPTION OF TASK PERFORMED:

This is a responsive web application that converts currencies in real time based on the selected country. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app fetches live exchange rates using the ExchangeRate.host API, and automatically identifies the official currency of the chosen country for accurate conversion.
In addition to converting currency, the app also displays the national flag of the selected country. This is achieved by linking country names to their ISO country codes and rendering flag images dynamically, enhancing the visual appeal and usability of the application.
Users can select a country from a dropdown menu, input an amount, and instantly see the converted value. The app updates both the currency and the flag automatically. It is fully responsive and designed to work smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
This project demonstrates key frontend skills including API integration, asynchronous JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and responsive design. Itâ€™s entirely frontend-based, with no backend required, and is perfect for showcasing how to build dynamic web applications that interact with external data in real time.

Ideal for developers looking to strengthen their skills in working with real-world APIs and building interactive, user-friendly interfaces.
